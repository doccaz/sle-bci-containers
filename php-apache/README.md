# What is this?

This is a fully-functional container with:
* SLE BCI
* PHP 8
* Oracle ODBC
* MS SQL clients
* Java 1.8.0
* PECL extensions
* regular PHP extensions
* a place to insert your SLES subscription (if you have it).

The idea is to demonstrate how easy it is to use the SUSE SLE-BCI images to achieve whatever you need, with hardened, secure base container images by SUSE.
